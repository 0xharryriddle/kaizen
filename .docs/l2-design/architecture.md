# Kaizen L2 Architecture Design

## Overview

Kaizen is an EVM-compatible, confidential, and high-performance Layer 2 rollup that combines the best features of Arbitrum's optimistic rollup approach with ZkSync's zero-knowledge proof capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Execution Layer (EVM)

- **Purpose**: Execute transactions using Ethereum Virtual Machine
- **Implementation**: go-ethereum integration
- **Features**:
  - Full EVM compatibility
  - Transaction execution and state management
  - Gas metering and fee calculation
  - Smart contract deployment and execution

### 2. Rollup Layer (L2)

- **Purpose**: Batch transactions and manage L2 state
- **Components**:
  - **Batcher**: Collects and batches transactions
  - **Sequencer**: Orders transactions and creates blocks
  - **State Manager**: Maintains L2 state and generates state roots
- **Features**:
  - Transaction ordering and batching
  - State commitment generation
  - Block production and finalization

### 3. Confidentiality Layer (ZK)

- **Purpose**: Provide privacy and confidential transactions
- **Implementation**: gnark-based zk-SNARK proofs
- **Features**:
  - Private transaction processing
  - Confidential smart contract execution
  - Anonymous transaction pools
  - Privacy-preserving bridges

### 4. Bridge Layer

- **Purpose**: Enable communication between L1 and L2
- **Components**:
  - **Deposit Processor**: Handles L1 to L2 deposits
  - **Withdrawal Processor**: Handles L2 to L1 withdrawals
  - **Message Relay**: Cross-chain message passing
- **Features**:
  - Asset bridging (ETH, ERC-20 tokens)
  - Cross-chain messaging
  - Proof verification for withdrawals

### 5. Consensus Layer

- **Purpose**: Achieve consensus among L2 validators
- **Implementation**: Custom consensus mechanism for L2
- **Features**:
  - Validator selection and rotation
  - Block finalization
  - Dispute resolution (for optimistic elements)

### 6. Storage Layer

- **Purpose**: Persistent storage for L2 state and data
- **Implementation**: LevelDB/RocksDB
- **Features**:
  - State storage and retrieval
  - Transaction and block storage
  - Efficient data compression
  - Data availability guarantees

## Data Flow

```
L1 Ethereum
     |
     v
Bridge Layer ←→ Cross-chain messages
     |
     v
Rollup Layer (Batcher/Sequencer)

Storage Layer ←→ Consensus Layer
```

## Security Model

### Optimistic + ZK Hybrid

- **Optimistic Elements**: Fast transaction processing with fraud proofs
- **ZK Elements**: Privacy preservation and validity proofs for critical operations
- **Dispute Resolution**: Challenge period for optimistic transactions
- **Data Availability**: Ensure transaction data is available for verification

### Threat Model

- **MEV Protection**: Confidential transaction ordering
- **Censorship Resistance**: Decentralized sequencer network
- **State Validity**: Cryptographic proofs for state transitions
- **Bridge Security**: Multi-signature and time-delayed withdrawals

## Performance Optimizations

### Parallel Execution

- Transaction dependency analysis
- Parallel execution of independent transactions
- State access optimization

### Batch Compression

- Transaction data compression
- Calldata optimization
- State diff compression

### Storage Efficiency

- Merkle tree optimizations
- State pruning and archival
- Efficient key-value storage

## Privacy Features

### Confidential Transactions

- zk-SNARK proofs for transaction privacy
- Hidden amounts and recipients
- Nullifier-based double-spending prevention

### Anonymous Pools

- Mixing protocols for enhanced privacy
- Confidential token transfers
- Privacy-preserving DeFi protocols

### Confidential Smart Contracts

- Private state execution
- Encrypted contract storage
- Selective disclosure mechanisms

## Integration Points

### Ethereum L1

- Smart contracts for deposits/withdrawals
- State root commitments
- Fraud/validity proof verification

### External Systems

- Oracles for price feeds
- Cross-chain bridges to other L2s
- Integration with DeFi protocols
